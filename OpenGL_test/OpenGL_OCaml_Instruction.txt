This is a basic instruction on how you guys can install Lablgl: a package that will allow you to bind OCaml and OpenGL together.

1. Go to

	http://wwwfun.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/soft/lsl/lablgl.html

2. Download

	lablgl-1.04.tar.gz
	Version 1.04. Requires Objective Caml 3.05 or more.

3. Unzip it and go into folder lablGL-1.04
4. Rename Makefile.config.osx to Makefile.config
5. Type

	make

6. Type

	make install

7. If successful, cd into LablGlut/examples/lablGL
You will see a lot of example source file of OCaml code that uses OpenGL for creating display screen. Try:

	lablglut gears.ml

8. I will follow up later regarding how we can compile the .ml file with OpenGL commands. For now, you should see if you can run the examples on step 7. README for more information.

9. Here we go. We can compile the ocaml source file with OpenGL bindings as follows:

	ocamlc -I +lablGL lablgl.cma lablglut.cma SOURCEFILE.ml -o EXECUTABLE_FILENAME

For example,

	ocamlc -I +lablGL lablgl.cma lablglut.cma simple.ml -o simple

It is EXTREMELY important that -I comes before source file in order of arguments. Otherwise we will get "Unbound of GLUT" error.
